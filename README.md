# Election_Analysis
## Project Overview of Election Audit:
 I provide a written analysis of the election audit for the election commission, including the new results by using Python.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes for each candidate received. 
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
6. Calculate the voter turnout for each county.
7. Calculate the percentage of votes from each county out of the total.
8. Determine the county with the highest turnout.
## Election-Audit Results: 
The analysis of the election shows that:
- There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.
- The voter turnout for each county was:
    - Jefferson produced 10.5% of voters, for a total of 38,855 voters.
    - Denver produced 82.8% of voters, for a total of 306,055 voters.
    - Arapahoe produced 6.7% of voters, for a total of 24,801 voters.
- The county with the largest voter turnout was:
    - Denver, which produced 82.8% of voters, for a total of 306,055 voters.
- The candidate results were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote, for a total of  85,213 votes.
    - Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote, for a total of 272,892 votes.
    - Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote, for a total of 11,606 votes.
- The winner of the election was:
    - Diana DeGette, who received 73.8% of the vote for a total of 272,892 votes.

## Election-Audit Summary: 
Expanding the Election Audit to include voter turnout by county with candidates results has been a great way to take advantage of the convenience a script provides.
We can use the same script guideness for the futer performance.Modifying the script to produce turnout results by county is just one of many ways that minor adjustments to the code can reveal critical data. 
For example, we could also dive deeper and determine what percentage of each county voted for each candidate by adding an if-statement to the code. No matter the number of candidates or counties, the script used to perform the Election Audit can be a valuable resourse for the board.
